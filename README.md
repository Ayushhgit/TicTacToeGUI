# TicTacToeGUI
Tic Tac Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols, usually 'X' and 'O'. The objective of the game is to be the first player to achieve a straight line of three of their symbols, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, on the grid.
